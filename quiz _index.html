            C: `<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                C, designed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, is one of the most influential programming languages 
                in history. Known as the "mother of all languages," it laid the foundation for modern languages like C++, Java, 
                and Python. C's simplicity, efficiency, and close interaction with hardware make it ideal for system programming, 
                operating systems, embedded systems, and real-time applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                The language provides control over low-level system components, such as memory and processor instructions, through 
                features like pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and file handling. These capabilities make C essential for developers 
                who need high performance and precise control, especially in fields like robotics, IoT, and game development.
                </p>
                <p>
                Mastering C is considered a rite of passage for aspiring programmers, as it introduces fundamental programming 
                concepts, including loops, functions, data structures, and algorithm design. Its enduring relevance makes it a 
                core subject in computer science curricula worldwide.
                </p>`,
    
            Java: `<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                Java, created by Sun Microsystems in 1995, is a versatile, object-oriented programming language widely known for its 
                platform independence, achieved through the "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle. By compiling into bytecode 
                that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java ensures compatibility across various devices and operating systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                Java is a cornerstone of enterprise software development, powering large-scale systems, banking applications, and e-commerce 
                platforms. It is also the backbone of Android app development, enabling the creation of millions of mobile applications. 
                With a robust standard library and frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and Struts, Java simplifies complex tasks such as 
                database interaction, networking, and web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                Its object-oriented principles—encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—promote code reusability, scalability, and 
                maintainability. Java also emphasizes security, making it a trusted choice for developing mission-critical applications. 
                With its active developer community and continuous evolution, Java remains a dominant force in software engineering.
                </p>`,
    
            Python: `<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                Python, developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991, is a high-level, interpreted programming language celebrated for its 
                simplicity, readability, and versatility. Its straightforward syntax makes it an excellent choice for beginners, while 
                its powerful libraries and frameworks cater to advanced developers in fields like data science, artificial intelligence, 
                and web development.
                </p>
                <p>
                Python is the preferred language for machine learning and AI applications, thanks to libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, 
                and Scikit-learn. It also excels in data analysis and visualization with tools like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. 
                In web development, frameworks like Django and Flask enable the rapid creation of robust, scalable applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                Python's versatility extends to scripting, automation, game development, and even scientific research. It supports 
                multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. As one of the most 
                popular languages worldwide, Python continues to dominate the tech industry, offering endless opportunities for innovation.
                </p>`,
    
            HTML: `<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, responsible for structuring and presenting content 
                on the World Wide Web. First introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993, HTML has evolved significantly, with HTML5 being the 
                latest version offering enhanced multimedia capabilities, semantic elements, and support for mobile-first design.
                </p>
                <p>
                HTML works seamlessly with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, forming the core trio of web technologies. 
                It uses tags and elements to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and multimedia content. Modern features 
                of HTML5, such as canvas for graphics, video/audio embedding, and offline storage, empower developers to create 
                sophisticated, responsive web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                HTML is essential for anyone entering the field of web development. Its simplicity and accessibility make it the 
                foundation upon which dynamic, visually appealing websites and applications are built. As the web continues to evolve, 
                HTML remains a critical skill for developers worldwide.
                </p>`,
    
            JavaScript: `<h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, is a high-level, interpreted language that brings interactivity and 
                dynamism to web pages. As a core web technology alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript allows developers to create 
                responsive user interfaces, animations, form validations, and real-time updates.
                </p>
                <p>
                Beyond the browser, JavaScript has expanded into server-side programming with Node.js, enabling developers to build 
                scalable backend systems. Frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js revolutionize front-end development by facilitating 
                the creation of complex, single-page applications (SPAs). JavaScript also powers mobile app development with frameworks 
                like React Native and desktop applications with tools like Electron.
                </p>
                <p>
                JavaScript's ability to interact with APIs and handle asynchronous operations makes it indispensable for modern 
                application development. As a constantly evolving language supported by a vibrant community, JavaScript continues 
                to drive innovation across the tech landscape, from web development to gaming and beyond.
